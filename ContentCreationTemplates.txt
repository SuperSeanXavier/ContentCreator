THE STORY
Spencer grabbed me like his birthday wish depended on it. Our bodies locked; our mouths pressed; his breath was hot against mine, and his hands and hips matched my pace. I knew exactly what he wanted, and he couldn't resist. I pushed him back onto the bed and slid down his body. My mouth traced down his stomach, his hips, and I grabbed his dick hard and swallowed hole. He opened his legs to feel more of me; I felt his thighs tremble, as I pushed his dick deeper down my throat. He lifted his legs without me asking - he was offering himself, wanting, waiting, begging me to move in closer. I spread his cheeks wide and dragged my tongue over his hole, make small slow circles, then going deeper and feeling his hole pulse and clinch over my tongue. I climbed up and positioned myself to fuck him missionary; but he pushed back, flipped over, and begged me for doggy, letting his ass do the talking. I gripped his waist and drove in hard; his back arched, and he hitched his breath as I plowed him deeper. I pinned him to the mattress, and he pushed his ass back, like he had been waiting all year for this exact moment. He moaned louder and louder, and our bodies slapped together sharp and fast. I locked down my gripped, buried myself into him, and came. My cum poured deep into him, and his hole gripped tight around my pulses. I cradled him there, dick deep inside, still throbbing, still leaking, not letting him go until the last tremor left us both.
